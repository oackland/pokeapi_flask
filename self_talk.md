right now im trying to create a new table to see if the new user is new or has been logged in before

the idea about this is to make it select the team and the pokemon beforehand

the database has been initialize already.

the table in under app/model.py\
the html is in
[landing.html](app/blueprints/main/main_templates/landing.html)
